How long can habitat-enhancing stream restoration persist or resist against hydrodynamic forces? 

 -- We answer this question with lifespan maps based on 2D hydrodynamic modeling and an ample literature review of stability parameters.

## About
Are you planning a river engineering intervention to improve its ecological status? Good habitat quality is just one design criterion. Another criterion is that the newly created habitat is sustainable and will not be destroyed by the next flood. We compared the results of 2D hydrodynamic models with stability parameters of stream restoration. The 2D modelling results indicate hydrodynamic forces and hydraulic habitat suitability in terms of flow velocity and depth. In an ample literature review, we analyze stability parameters of stream restoration features such as vegetation plantings, artificially introduced streamwood, streambed terraforming, sediment introduction, or boulder placement, and others. Vetting the 2D modelling results against the stability parameters produces lifespan maps. 
In our new paper we present technical detailed descriptions of stream restoration features. We illustrate the production of lifespan maps using a testbed river. For 50 days freely accessible with open access: Hydro-morphological parameters generate lifespan maps for stream restoration management. Thank you all Co-Authors the prolific collaboration and special thanks to all peers for your support!

## Data and Codes
Since the publication of the original paper, we implemented the algorithms in the advanced river analysis and design tool *River Architect*.
