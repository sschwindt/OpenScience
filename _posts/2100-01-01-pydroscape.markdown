`pydroscape` provides *Python3* tools for many sorts of riverscape-related analyses, including tools for geodata statistics, plotting and processing of other data. I started programming `pydroscape` to provide useful, generalized routines for signal processing, analyses, and processing of raw data from loggers, numerical models, or geospatial databases.

## About

`pydroscape` is the baseline of my Python packages for papers published before 2019. [Download](https://github.com/sschwindt/pydroscape/zipball/master) it, read more on the [`pydroscape` gihub pages](https://sschwindt.github.io/pydroscape/), and read its [wiki](https://sschwindt.github.io/pydroscape/#documentation-wiki) to get started.
