An update on the design of flood protection in mountain regions: In our paper [*Sediment traps with guiding channel and hybrid check dams improve controlled sediment retention*](https://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/18/647/2018/), we show how sustainable seidment traps are designed for minimizing eco-morphological impacts, maximizing flood safety, and reducing maintenance costs.
