The reproducibility of scientific analyses is a hallmark of sound research. Python codes are the backbone of my data analysis and this repository provides these codes. 

Documentation is a special concern to me and I do my best to enable others to use my codes and data. Even though most codes are self-explanatory, I provide additional information in wikis and readme files in the respective repositories. Please be patient with the code descriptions, which sometimes take some time to become comprehensible.

Regular posts will link to repositories with publication-specific data and codes.
