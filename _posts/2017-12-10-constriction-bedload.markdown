Two-phase flows occurring at natural or artificial flow constrictions such as bridges or open check dams are complex, especially for steep rivers with bedload transport. We analyze the underlying phenomena in our paper [*Effects of lateral and vertical constrictions on flow in rough steep channels with bedload*](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%29HY.1943-7900.0001389).
